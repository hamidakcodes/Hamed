### AI Engineer | Founder Mindset  
**Learning and Building in Public**

## About Me

I’m an AI Engineer in progress with a strong **founder mindset**.

My focus is not on training models from scratch, but on **building intelligent systems** using modern AI tools — systems that understand data, reason over context, and solve real-world problems.

I believe AI is not about algorithms alone, but about **systems, product thinking, and execution**.

---

## What I’m Focusing On

- Building AI-powered systems using **LLMs**
- Designing **RAG pipelines** and data-aware AI applications
- Working with **vector databases** and semantic search
- Applying software engineering principles to AI products
- Thinking in terms of **scalability, usability, and business value**

---

## How I Learn

I follow a simple philosophy:

> Learn what matters.  
> Build what’s useful.  
> Share everything openly.

I don’t separate learning from building.  
Every concept I study is applied directly to a real system or product.

---

## Current Direction

- AI Engineering (LLMs, RAG, AI Systems)
- Product-oriented development
- Building projects in public
- Exploring ideas that can evolve into **real startups**

---

## Projects

More projects will be added as I continue building and learning.

---

## Tech Stack (Evolving)

- Python
- LLM APIs
- Vector Databases
- Backend Systems
- AI Tooling & Orchestration

## Why This Repository Exists

This repository is part of my journey to:
- Document my learning process
- Build real AI systems
- Connect with builders, founders, and engineers
- Create opportunities for collaboration and startups

---

## Philosophy

I’m not chasing hype.  
I’m building foundations.

AI is a tool.  
Systems create value.  
Execution makes the difference.
